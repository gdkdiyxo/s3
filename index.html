<p>Hello, and welcome to Spotify's Cookie Policy ("<strong>Policy</strong>").</p> 
<p>The objective of this Policy is to provide you, a user of Spotify's services and/or websites (collectively, the "Services"), with clear information about the cookies that Spotify uses, the role they play in helping us provide Spotify to you, and the choices you have when it comes to managing your cookie settings.</p> 
<h2><a href="#1-what-are-cookies" id="1-what-are-cookies">1. What are cookies?</a></h2> 
<p>Cookies are files which are downloaded to your device, for example, when you visit a website. They are useful because they allow Spotify and our partners to recognise a user's device and support the continuity of your experience. You can find more information about cookies at: <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> or <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>.</p> 
<h2><a href="#2-how-do-we-use-cookies" id="2-how-do-we-use-cookies">2. How do we use cookies?</a></h2> 
<p>Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and improving your user experience. They can also help to ensure that ads you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.</p> 
<p>There are a few different categories of cookies, including:</p> 
<p><strong><em>Strictly Necessary Cookies</em></strong></p> 
<p>These cookies are set by Spotify or a third party on our behalf, and are essential to enable you to use the basic features of our Services, such as technically delivering content, setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. Without these cookies, services you have asked for e.g. payment, cannot be provided.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Optional Cookies</em></strong></p> 
<p>Optional cookies may be "first party cookies" or "third party cookies" as explained in the table below. You can find out more about how to control "Always Active" cookies in Options for managing cookies and interest-based ads.</p>

<h2><a href="#3-options-for-managing-cookies-and-interest-based-ads" id="3-options-for-managing-cookies-and-interest-based-ads">3. Options for managing cookies and interest-based ads</a></h2> 
<p>There are several options available for managing your cookie preferences, depending on the cookie type and your device. Each of the options are described below. Please note that no one option is sufficient to manage all cookies on all devices. Therefore, you may wish to combine one or more options for complete coverage.</p> 
<h3><a href="#browser-settings" id="browser-settings">Browser Settings</a></h3> 
<p>You can use your web browser settings to accept, refuse and delete cookies. You can withdraw or modify your consent to our use of cookies at any time, with the exception of strictly necessary cookies (as described above). To do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the "Help", "Tools" or "Edit" settings).</p> 
<h3><a href="#consent-management-platform" id="consent-management-platform">Consent Management Platform</a></h3> 
<p>In addition, Spotify participates in the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework and complies with its specifications and policies. We use a consent management platform ("<strong>CMP</strong>") with the identification number 28. You may view the CMP and access your cookie settings at <a href="#optanon-toggle-info-display">CMP</a>. The CMP allows you to consent to the setting of optional cookies by us and our third-party partners. Using the CMP, you can manage your preferences in relation to how first party cookies are set according to the category of cookie, as described in Section 2 <a href="#2-how-do-we-use-cookies">How do we use cookies?</a> . Additionally, third party cookies can be managed according to the purpose for which your data is processed or according to which third-party partners are involved. The CMP also allows us to maintain records of your consent. If you wish to update your consent choices via the CMP, please visit <a href="#optanon-toggle-info-display">CMP</a>.</p> 
<p>As set out above, certain third party optional cookie purposes are described as "Always Active", however if you do not wish cookie data to be processed for these purposes then you may toggle off the control next to "store and/or access information" on a device in the CMP <a href="#optanon-toggle-info-display">CMP</a>.</p> 
<p>Please note that as with your web browser settings you will not be able to withdraw consent for cookies which are strictly necessary for the Service to operate.</p> 
<h3><a href="#mobile-identifiers" id="mobile-identifiers">Mobile Identifiers</a></h3> 
<p>On your mobile device, your operating system may provide you with options to opt out of interest based advertising or to otherwise reset your mobile identifier. This is a unique identifier that can be used to identify a mobile device which works in a similar way to a cookie. For example, you may use the "Limit Ad Tracking" setting (on iOS devices) or a setting to "Opt out of Interest-Based Ads" (on Android) which allows you to limit the use of information about your use of apps for purposes of serving ads targeted to your interests.</p> 
<h3><a href="#cookies-on-the-spotify-desktop-application" id="cookies-on-the-spotify-desktop-application">Cookies on the Spotify Desktop Application</a></h3> 
<p>You can withdraw your consent to our use of cookies on Spotify's desktop application at any time. If you no longer wish to receive cookies, navigate to your Account Settings page on desktop to find the control under "Advanced" - "Privacy". When the control is turned on, it will block cookies from that installation of the Spotify desktop application on that computer; if you have Spotify installed on more than one machine, or if you re-install the application, then you will need to turn the feature on for each installation. You will need to restart the application for this feature to take effect. Please note that if you set the Spotify desktop application to block cookies, then your Spotify experience may be affected.</p> 
<h3><a href="#interest-based-advertising" id="interest-based-advertising">Interest-Based Advertising</a></h3> 
<p>Certain targeted advertisements that we (or a service provider acting on our behalf) display to you based on information about your online activities across websites and other interactive properties operated by third parties may include the "Ad Choices" icon or another mechanism to opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements. You may click on the AdChoices icon or visit <a href="https://aboutads.info/">www.aboutads.info</a> to receive more information about the collection and use of information about your online activities for interest based advertising or to learn how to opt out of having your data used for interest based advertising by Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) participating companies.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li> <p>Canadian users can also visit <a href="https://www.youradchoices.ca/">www.youradchoices.ca</a>.</p> </li> 
 <li> <p>European users can also visit <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/">www.youronlinechoices.com</a> to learn how to opt out of having their data used for interest-based advertising by European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) member companies.</p> </li> 
 <li> <p>The Network Advertising Initiative's (NAI) Opt-Out Tool at <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a> allows you to opt out from the use of information about your online activities for interest based advertising by NAI member companies.</p> </li> 
</ul> 
<p>You may also opt-out of receiving interest-based advertisements by turning off the "Tailored ads" toggle, located in the Privacy Settings page of your Spotify Account Settings. If you opt-out of receiving interest-based ads using the Tailored ads toggle, Spotify will not share your information with third party advertising partners or use information received by them to show you interest-based ads. We will also not show you interest-based ads based on information Spotify collects about your use of the Spotify Service over time. If you opt out, we will still show you ads based on your Spotify registration information and real-time usage but they will not be specifically tailored to you. For more information, please visit the Spotify <a href="#">Privacy Center</a>.</p> 
<p>Please note that even if you opt out using the mechanisms above, you may still receive advertisements when using the Spotify Service.</p> 
<h2><a href="#4-updates-to-this-policy" id="4-updates-to-this-policy">4. Updates to this Policy</a></h2> 
<p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.</p> 
<p>When we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or by sending you an email if you are a user of the Spotify Service. We may notify you in advance.</p>
